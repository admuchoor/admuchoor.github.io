    <p>
        One day, I went to get food with some friends and I put my card down to pay. 
        There were multiple items and each item was split between a different subset of people, so 
        I realized that figuring out how much each person owed was quite a tedious process. To solve
        this problem, I decided to automate this process in an easy (at least to me) way. This is Splitty!
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h1>How many items were there?</h1>
    <input id="numItems"> <br> <br>
    <button id="button" onclick="generateSpreadsheet()">Submit</button>

    <h1 id="message"> </h1>
    
    <p>
        Note that for the purpose of calculating each person's share of the tax, tip, and other fees,
        Splitty uses a "proportional split". For example, let's say Tom ordered hot wings that cost 
        $8, and Jerry ordered a side dish that cost $2. This makes the subtotal $10. Now let's say 
        the tax, tip, and additional fees were an extra $10. This makes the total $20. In my opinion, 
        it doesn't seem fair for Jerry to have to pay half of the additional fees when they only got 
        a side! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYb9jnt2cv4" target="_blank"> Others may 
        agree :)</a> Instead, they should be charged for the proportion of items that they bought.
        If you fed this bill into Splitty, it would report that Tom owes $16 and that Jerry owes $4.
