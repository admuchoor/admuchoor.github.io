                <h3>ABOUT ME</font></h6>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Novi, Michigan, a half hour drive to the place I now call home: Ann Arbor. I’m currently a student at the University of Michigan, pursuing a B.S.E. in Computer Science.
                    
                    <br><br>Some of my hobbies include debating my friends on why Messi and LeBron are the GOATs, watching anything directed by Christopher Nolan, and listening to music (some of my favorite artists are Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West, Dave, and <a href='https://open.spotify.com/artist/53zWDU5Qg96iAqYDFKbQPG?si=Sy1oYGfPThir381VQ05zzg' target="_blank">Zander</a>)!

                    <br><br> On campus, I serve as an Instructional Aide for the class EECS 482: Operating Systems, where I help students build involved projects like a thread library, virtual memory pager, and remote file server. Upon graduation, I'll be joining <a href='https://fiverings.com' target="_blank">Five Rings Capital</a> as a Software Developer!

                        I thoroughly enjoyed this class - it blended lecture content about the history of networking with extremeley interesting and applied projects that bolstered my C and C++ skills. The first project involved implementing the DASH protocol, which taught me about HTTP proxies, DNS servers, and video CDNs. The second project (which was my favorite) involved implementing a reliable transport protocol (similar to TCP but built on top of UDP), and taught me a lot about the sliding window technique as used by senders and receivers, different methods of flow control, and implementations of congestion control. The final project was significantly more low level, and involved designing a static router that abided by layer 2 and 3 protocols like ARP and ICMP. Overall, I really enjoyed working on the projects and getting better at designing effective software!

                        This course was an effective introduction to both the theory and implementation of machine learning algorithms. Topics included supervised learning (regression, classification, kernel methods, neural networks, and regularization) and unsupervised learning (clustering, density estimation, and dimensionality reduction). I particularly enjoyed the practical applications of machine learning to computer vision, data mining, and text processing through the projects, which were done in Python using modules like scikit-learn, pytorch, and more!

                        This was a capstone course, which involved myself working in a group to work on a project over the course of the semester. We learned about the entire Agile development cycle, and I was involved in the Planning, UI/UX Design, Feature Prototyping, and Development processes. I really enjoyed the feeling of working on an end-to-end project and producing a final product at the end of the semester.

                        Before taking this class, I was intimidated by everything I'd heard about it: extremely long projects, conceptually hard to understand spec sheets, and extremely long projects! However, I can say with certainty that this was my favorite class taken in college so far. The course revolved around three major projects: building a thread library, a virtual memory pager, and a remote file server. Working on these projects taught me so much about key operating systems concepts, best practices in software design and development, modern C++ tips and tricks, effective testing techniques, and so much more. In fact, I enjoyed this class so much that I'm now working as an Instructional Aide to help run it!

                        This class brought me an interesting blend of theoretical concepts and low-level development. During lectures, we learned about the composition of modern compilers and detailed breakdowns of the theory behind the various compilation stages, and the projects involved iteratively building a working compiler to convert Decaf source code to MIPS assembly. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about such an integral part of the software development process.

                        This was one of my favorite courses I’ve taken so far. Unlike most of my other coding-intensive EECS classes, this felt more like a math class characterized by formal proofs and requiring a different approach to problem solving. Some of the most important and interesting concepts covered were analyzing algorithms, Turing machines, the classes of P and NP, and randomness and cryptography. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about these new concepts and found that this class influenced my approach to critically thinking about abstract concepts. I also loved typesetting my assignments in LaTeX :)

                        In all of my previous EECS classes, I had learned how to express tasks in terms of high-level programming languages like C++. In this class, I was introduced to a whole different world and learned more about how a low-level language is executed by the hardware. The majority of the class involved building projects like simulators and linkers for a fictional assembly language called LC-2K, but I was also given an introduction to important concepts like caching and virtual memory. Ultimately, this class served as an effective introduction to low-level computing.

                        This was a special topics course in Sports Analytics that I took with the Dean of the School of Information. It involved a “classroom component” of weekly lectures in which we learned about prevailing theories in sports analytics as well as a “field component” in which we were assigned to work with a team within the university’s athletic department. I worked with the Women’s Lacrosse team, assisting with their adoption of a fitness-tracking technology and creating tools that were subsequently integrated into their daily protocol. This was a fantastic opportunity for me to get experience working with a smaller, yet disciplined, organization of non-technical professionals that allowed me to take control of my own project.

                        This was an introductory course required for all students in the College of Engineering. I enrolled in the Food Science section with the purpose of learning more about a discipline that I was unfamiliar with. The course culminated in a final project through which our group recommended a new equity design and packaging prototype to our client, General Mills. The experience of consulting with a major corporation as well as bolstering my technical communication skills proved to be valuable.

I can say with certainty that this is my favorite class that I’ve taken to date. I learned about various data structures like maps, sets, graphs, stacks, and queues, as well as algorithm families like dynamic programming, branch and bound, backtracking, and greedy.

                            As someone who was always interested in math but most recently familiar with calculus, this class was a great introduction to “a different side” of mathematics. The most important thing I gained from this class was a foundation for proof-based mathematics through the formal introduction of concepts like propositional logic, induction, sets, counting, discrete probability, and graph theory. The emphasis on logical problem solving instilled in me by this class also pervaded different aspects of my education as well as my life, and ultimately inspired me to pursue a Mathematics minor.
